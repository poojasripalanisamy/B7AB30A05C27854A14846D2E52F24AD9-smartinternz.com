#3.1 Write a function called linear_search_product that takes the list of products and a target product name as input. The function should perform a linear search to find the target product in the list and return a list of indices of all occurrences of the product if found, or an empty list if the product is not found.
def linear_search_product(product_list, target_product):
    indices = []
    for i, product in enumerate(product_list):
        if product == target_product:
            indices.append(i)
    return indices

# Example usage:
products = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "apple"]
target = "apple"
result = linear_search_product(products, target)
if result:
    print(f"The product '{target}' was found at indices: {result}")
else:
    print(f"The product '{target}' was not found in the list.")

      self.name = name
      self.roll_number = roll_number
      self.cgpa = cgpa

  # Sort the list of students in descending order of CGPA

                          reverse=True)
  return sorted_students

# Example usage:
students = [
  Student("Hari", "A123", 7.8),
  Student("Srikanth", "A124", 8.9),
  Student("Saumya", "A125", 9.1),
